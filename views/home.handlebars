  <h3>Why are you building this?</h3>

  <p>
    We want to bring a dose of reality to the Internet of Things hype.
    <a href="data.sparkfun.com">data.sparkfun.com</a> is a free, robust
    service for use with all of your projects. The underlying engine is
    open source so if you don't want to use our servers you can install
    <a href="https://github.com/sparkfun/phant">phant</a> on the server
    of your choice.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I use it?</h3>

  <p>
    We thought data storage should be as easy as string concatenation. First,
    create a stream and you'll receive a public url and a private key. Then,
    using the hardware of your choice (Ethernet shield, RasPi, BBB, Electric Imp,
    WiFly) simply create a string with the data you want to post. Here's a simple example:
  </p>

  <p class="truncate">
    <a href="http://data.sparkfun.com/input/Jxyjr7DmxwTD5dG1D1Kv?private_key=gzgnB4VazkIg7GN1g1qA&amp;brewTemp=33.4">
      http://data.sparkfun.com/input/Jxyjr7DmxwTD5dG1D1Kv?private_key=gzgnB4VazkIg7GN1g1qA&amp;brewTemp=33.4
    </a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Go ahead and try it! Post
    <a href="http://data.sparkfun.com/input/Jxyjr7DmxwTD5dG1D1Kv?private_key=gzgnB4VazkIg7GN1g1qA&amp;brewTemp=33.4">
      the string above
    </a>
    into a browser window and hit return. You should see a confirmation message. Then view the results on the
    <a href="http://data.sparkfun.com/streams/Jxyjr7DmxwTD5dG1D1Kv">the public stream</a>. Congrats!
    You just added some data to the internet.
  </p>

  <h3>What types of projects would benefit from this service?</h3>

  <p>
    Almost anything. Your weather station in the backyard. A classroom
    of kids working on science experiments. A community concerned with
    pollution and crowdsourcing data collection. The weight of your pug's
    food dish. You get the idea. If your project can send an http request,
    you can push data out to our servers.
  </p>

  <h3>How much data can I push?</h3>

  <p>
    You can push new information to your stream once every 10s. Each stream
    has a maximum of 50mb. After you hit the limit, the oldest data will be erased.
    (These limitations can be removed if installed on your own server).
  </p>

  <h3>Can I publish a stream anonymously?</h3>

  <p>
    Yes. But all streams are public and can be accessed by anyone with the url.
  </p>

  <h3>How can I give feedback about this project?</h3>

  <p>
    Send us an email: <a href="mailto:data@sparkfun.com">data@sparkfun.com</a>
  </p>

  <h3>Is my data safe?</h3>

  <p>
    Absolutely not. We are still hacking on the core functionality. Feel free
    to kick the tires, but be aware that your data might be erased at any time.
    After our official launch, we will have clear parameters for how long the data
    will remain on our servers.
  </p>

  <h3>Gimme the code!</h3>

  <p>

    <a href="https://github.com/sparkfun/phant">GitHub</a>. Please let us know
    if you run into any <a href="https://github.com/sparkfun/phant/issues">issues</a>.
